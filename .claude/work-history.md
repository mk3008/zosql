# Work History Record

## Overview
This file leverages Claude Code's Memory feature to automatically record and accumulate work history in the project.

## Recording Format

### Date-based Work Records
Record work content for each session in the following format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - [Work Category]
**Purpose**: [Objective and requirements of the work]
**Implementation**: [Summary of actual work performed]
**Deliverables**: [Created/modified files]
**Issues & Improvements**: [Problems discovered and areas for improvement]
**Handover Notes**: [Ongoing work and important notes]
```

### Cumulative Improvement Knowledge
Accumulate knowledge and patterns gained through work:

```markdown
## Improvement Knowledge Database
- **[Technical Domain]**: [Specific learning and improvement content]
- **[Problem Patterns]**: [Common problems and their solutions]
- **[Efficiency Methods]**: [Methods to improve work efficiency]
```

## Automatic Recording Mechanism

### History Reference via Memory Import
