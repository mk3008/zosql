# Architecture Principles

## Use Functional Programming with Hexagonal Architecture
**Why**: Pure functions and immutable data create predictable, testable code. Hexagonal architecture isolates business logic from external dependencies.

### Implement Layered Architecture
**Why**: Clear separation prevents coupling and makes code easier to maintain and test
**How**: UI/API → Services → Domain → Infrastructure, dependencies point inward

### Use Pure Functions for Business Logic
**Why**: Pure functions are predictable, testable, and have no side effects
**How**: Services contain pure business logic, take dependencies as parameters

### Define Ports as Function Interfaces
**Why**: Function interfaces are simpler and promote functional composition
**How**: Use type definitions with function signatures, not classes

### Use Readonly Types for Immutable Data
**Why**: Immutable data prevents accidental mutations and makes state changes explicit
**How**: Define interfaces with `readonly` properties, create new objects for updates

### Pass Dependencies as Function Parameters
**Why**: Makes dependencies explicit and enables easy testing and mocking
**How**: Pure functions take all dependencies as parameters, no hidden external calls

### Group Related Functions in Service Objects
**Why**: Service objects organize related business logic and provide clear API boundaries
**How**: Export service objects with grouped pure functions for related domain logic

### Use Result Pattern for Error Handling
**Why**: Explicit error handling makes error states visible in the type system
**How**: Return `Result<T, E>` type with success/error discriminated union

### Test Pure Functions Directly
**Why**: Pure functions are easy to test with predictable inputs and outputs, no mocking required
**How**: Test business logic directly without complex setup or external dependencies
