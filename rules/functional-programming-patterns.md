# Functional Programming Patterns

**DEPRECATED**: This file has been integrated into `rules/architecture-principles.md`

All functional programming patterns (pure functions, immutable data, Result pattern, service objects, and testing approaches) are now consolidated in the architecture principles file to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

Please refer to `rules/architecture-principles.md` for functional programming guidance.
