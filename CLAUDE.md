## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Task Tool Usage

When using the Task tool to call agents, be aware of the distinction between **analysis agents** and **implementation agents**:

### Analysis-Only Agents
These agents provide recommendations and analysis but DO NOT modify files:
- **claude-code-advisor**: Provides workflow guidance and tool recommendations
- **retrospective-analyzer**: Records and analyzes work history (only modifies work-history.md)

### Implementation Agents  
These agents WILL create/modify files when called:
- **dev-coordinator**, **qa-analyzer**: Delegate to implementation specialists
- **e2e-test-agent**: Creates/modifies test files
- **rule-organizer**: Modifies documentation and rule files

**Always check `git diff` after Task tool usage** to verify expected vs actual file changes.

**How to Choose**: Start with **dev-coordinator** for most development tasks - it will automatically route you to the right specialist. Use specific agents directly when you have focused needs in their domain.
